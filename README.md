## Exploratory Analysis Insights

- Profitability Growth: The average movie profitability has significantly increased over time, with an average profit in the 2010s reaching over $130 million. This suggests a trend of higher-budget, high-revenue movies in recent decades.

- Top Grossing Movies: The most profitable movies include Avatar, Titanic, and Jurassic World, each with profits over $1 billion. This highlights the impact of blockbuster franchises and high-budget productions on profitability.

- Language Diversity: English dominates the dataset with 4,505 movies, followed by French (70) and Spanish (32). Non-English films have a smaller presence, indicating an English-language preference in popular movies.

- Popularity Trends: The 2010s have seen the highest average movie popularity score, around 29.3. This suggests recent movies attract more attention, potentially due to globalized streaming platforms and social media influence.

- Runtime Trends: Average movie runtimes have declined over the years, from around 197 minutes in the 1910s to approximately 106 minutes in the 2010s. This shift may reflect changing audience preferences for shorter, more concise films.
